    "In the previous two chapter's {numref}`FirstLaw` {ref}`FirstLaw` and {numref}`FirstLawApplications` {ref}`FirstLawApplications`, we were focused on applying the energy conservation equation to closed systems, where there was no mass exchange with the surroundings. However, there are many thermodynamic systems where accounting for the mass transfer and energy transfer is critical, such as  turbines, mixing chambers, and so on. Recall that these are considered {ref}`open systems <genindex>`. To evaluate open systems, the energy conservation equation for a closed system is modified to account for the energy content of the mass entering and/or leaving the system. Further, a new concept called {ref}`flow work <genindex>` will have to be acocunted for, which is related to the work done by or to the fluid entering or leaving the system, and is the force behind it's movement.

    "In addition to heat transfer and boundary work interactions that were considered in the closed system energy conservation equation, flow work and energy content of the mass entering or leaving the system need to also be accounted for in open systems. We have already defined the flow work above. The energy $E$ of the mass that enters is it's specific energy content, $e$, scaled by the mass, $m$, or $E = em$. And further, this can be broken down into the individual components, internal energy ($U$), kinetic energy ($KE$) and potential energy ($PE$). These terms should not be confused with the system's energy which can also be broken down similarly. Thus, we can say the energy content that entered ($E$<sub>i</sub>) or exited ($E$<sub>e</sub>) the control volume is the following."

For example in turbines (discussed later in this chapter), the inlet and exit heights are often neglected because the overall change in potential energy is often more than an order or magnitude lower than the shaft work terms.\n",

Because there is a single inlet and exit, inlet and exit mass flowrates are idential because of mass conservation. Typically, there is no shaft work in pipe flow applications and this is indicated to be equal to zero. Depending on the application, tere may be energy transfer to or from the system in the form of heat transfer.

A schematic of a turbine is shown in {numref}`Figure %s <first law fig f>`  on the left. Notice that the inlet area is smaller than the exit area as a result of expansion. Often, the change in kinetic energy and potential energy is negligable compared to the change in enthalpy of the fluid, especially in gas and vapor turbines, but not always.

Pumps are typically treated as adiabatic systems, like compressors, and the velocity change contributing to changes in kinetic energy are usually negligable.

In fact, compared to compressors, there is usually only a very small increase in temperature as pressure increases. And although the exit temperature will be higher, it is often assumed to be equal to the inlet because of limited compressed liquid data available in tabulated form. Since we will be using Cantera this is not an issue for this text, but it is worth taking some time to discuss the implications of these assumptions. We discussed prior in {numref}`LiquidApproximation` {ref}`LiquidApproximation`, that $v$ and $u$ are functions of temperature only and independent of pressure for incomressible substances. Assuming liquid incompressibility can help us evaluate pumping work in the absense of some compressed liquid data. First, recalling the definition of enthalpy and differentiating, we see the following."

    "A {ref}`heat exchanger<genindex>` is a steady state flow device design to heat or cool a fluid through heat transfer. The fluid can be a gas, liquid, liquid-vapor mixture and undergo phase change during the heating or cooling process. Often, heat exchangers are designed with two separate fluid streams each with an inlet and exit, such that there is thermal contact (i.e., heat transfer) from one fluid (hot side) to another (cold side). The fluid flows can be counter to each other, in a so-called counter-flow heat exchanger, or parallel to each other, and with various configurations. The design and configuration of heat exchangers is beyond the scope of this text and we will consider them only from a control-volume perspective. For counter-flow heat exchangers, they are often assumed adiabatic, meaning there is no net-heat transfer to or from the system at large. But, as mentioned, there is internal heat transfer from one fluid to another, and if the control volume were drawn around the specific fluid of interest then heat transfer would need to be considered. An exemplary heat exchanger is shown below in {numref}`Figure %s <first law fig h>`. In this example, the flows are counter to each other and there are two total inlets and exits to consider in the control volume. And although the heat exchanger is typically drawn this way, heat exchangers can also have only a single inlet and exit and include external heat transfer."

    "A {ref}`mixing chamber<genindex>` is a steady state flow device design to bring two or more streams into thermal equilibrium with one another by combining their fluid flows. This is in contrast to heat exchangers where the fluids are only in thermal contact with one another, but there is no mixing of substances. The fluids can be gas, liquid, liquid-vapor mixture and leave as any of these. An exemplary mixing chamber is shown below in {numref}`Figure %s <first law fig i>`. In this example, two streams enter and combine into a single exit stream. As a result of mass conservation, the two inlet mass flowrates must be equal to the exit mass flowrate. Typical assumptions used to simplify the open system energy conservation equation are no boundary/shaft work, adiabatic (i.e. only internal heat transfer) and negligable changes in kinetic and potential energies of each fluid stream. Similar to mixing chambers are {ref}`separation devices<genindex>`, that often have a single inlet and multiple outlets. These are useful in cases where saturated liquid-vapor mixtures are to be separated by supplying an outlet at the bottom for condensate and at the top for the vapor fraction."

    "Without readily available equations of state (such as those in Cantera) it is typical to evaluate thermodynamic processes with ideal gases using specific heats. However, if there is a large change in temperature during the process (e.g., in a turbine), then assuming constant specific heats may not be a good approxomation. But often, we may not know a priori what the inlet or exit temperature is, and thus the question of what temperature range should be used to evaluate specific heat arises.

    "Using a pencil and paper approach to solve a problem this way would be tedious and require trial and error, guessing the appropriate temperature until the energy equation is satisfied. However, since we are working with Python, we can take advantage of its built in solvers and/or minimization routines to help solve problems like this more easily. For example, lets assume we know the power output of an nitrogen-based gas turbine is 500 MW and the inlet temperature and pressure are 500 <sup>o</sup>C and 1.1 MPa. We also know that the mass flowrate is 50 kg/s and wish to know the exit temperature. The simplified open system energy conservation equation in this case is:"

    "For the purposes of this example, we will also only use the fit for the temperature range 500-2000 K to limit the computational complexity. Also, notice the units of enthalpy after integration are in kJ/mol. To be consistent with our example we will need to convert from mol to kg - thus we will divide our change in enthalpy by 28 g/mol and multiply by 1000 to convert from g to kg. Before using more elaborate solution solutions, lets just try a guess and check approach. To do this we can define a function $func$ which should equal zero if our exit temperature is correct. I.e.:"

    "1. The turbocharger of an internal combustion engine consists of a turbine and a compressor. Hot exhaust gases flow through the turbine to produce work, and the work output from the turbine is used as the work input to the compressor. The pressure of ambient air is increased as it flows through the compressor before it enters the engine cylinders. Thus, the purpose of a turbocharger is to increase the pressure of air so that more air gets into the cylinder. Consequently, more fuel can be burned and more power can be produced by the engine. In a turbocharger, exhaust gases enter the turbine at 400°C and 120 kPa at a rate of 0.02 kg/s and leave at 350°C. Air enters the compressor at 50°C and 100 kPa and leaves at 130 kPa at a rate of 0.018 kg/s. The compressor increases the air pressure with a side effect: It also increases the air temperature, which increases the possibility that a gasoline engine will experience an engine knock. To avoid this, an aftercooler is placed after the compressor to cool the warm air with cold ambient air before it enters the engine cylinders. It is estimated that the aftercooler must decrease the air temperature below 80°C if knock is to be avoided. The cold ambient air enters the aftercooler at 30°C and leaves at 40°C. Disregarding any frictional losses in the turbine and the compressor and treating the exhaust gases as air, determine:\n",

    "    1. the minimum volume flow rate of ambient air required to avoid knock.\n",
    "1. A 2 m3 rigid insulated tank initially containing saturated water vapor at 1 MPa is connected through a valve to a supply line that carries steam at 400°C. Now the valve is opened, and steam is allowed to flow slowly into the tank until the pressure in the tank rises to 2 MPa. At this instant the tank temperature is measured to be 300 °C. Determine the mass of the steam that has entered and the pressure of the steam in the supply line.\n",
    "1. A 2 m3 rigid tank initially contains air at 100 kPa and 22°C. The tank is connected to a supply line through a valve. Air is flowing in the supply line at 600 kPa and 22°C. The valve is opened, and air is allowed to enter the tank until the pressure in the tank reaches the line pressure, at which point the valve is closed. A thermometer placed in the tank indicates that the air temperature at the final state is 77°C. Determine (a) the mass of air that has entered the tank and (b) the amount of heat transfer.\n",
    "2. 1. Steam enters a turbine through a 1 m diameter pipe at *_V_* = 2 m/s. The steam is at *_T_* = 700 K and *_P_* = 5 MPa and it leaves at 1 MPa at *_T_* = 400 K .

    "3. Water enters a heat exchanger at a rate of 20 kg/s as a saturated water vapor at *_P_* = 1 MPa. The water cools until is has a vapor mass fraction of 50%. At this point water is rerouted from the heat exchanger at a rate of 4 kg/s. The remaining fluid continues in the heat exchanger until the water is a saturated liquid. What is the heat transfer (*_Q_*) from the water to the heat exchanger?\n",
