    "# The turbocharger of an internal combustion engine consists of a turbine and a compressor. Hot exhaust gases flow through the turbine to produce work, and the work output from the turbine is used as the work input to the compressor. \n",
    "# The pressure of ambient air is increased as it flows through the compressor before it enters the engine cylinders. Thus, the purpose of a turbocharger is to increase the pressure of air so that more air gets into the cylinder. \n",
    "# Consequently, more fuel can be burned and more power can be produced by the engine. In a turbocharger, exhaust gases enter the turbine at 400°C and 120 kPa at a rate of 0.02 kg/s and leave at 350°C. \n",
    "#Air enters the compressor at 50°C and 100 kPa and leaves at 130 kPa at a rate of 0.018 kg/s. The compressor increases the air pressure with a side effect: It also increases the air temperature, which increases the possibility that a gasoline engine will experience an engine knock. \n",
